\section{Stats}{


All \verb{stat_*} functions (like \code{stat_bin}) return a layer that
contains a \verb{Stat*} object (like \code{StatBin}). The \verb{Stat*}
object is responsible for rendering the data in the plot.

Each of the \verb{Stat*} objects is a \code{\link[=ggproto]{ggproto()}} object, descended
from the top-level \code{Stat}, and each implements various methods and
fields. To create a new type of Stat object, you typically will want to
override one or more of the following:
\itemize{
\item One of :
\code{compute_layer(self, data, scales, ...)},
\code{compute_panel(self, data, scales, ...)}, or
\code{compute_group(self, data, scales, ...)}.

\code{compute_layer()} is called once per layer, \code{compute_panel_()}
is called once per panel, and \code{compute_group()} is called once per
group. All must return a data frame.

It's usually best to start by overriding \code{compute_group}: if
you find substantial performance optimisations, override higher up.
You'll need to read the source code of the default methods to see
what else you should be doing.

\code{data} is a data frame containing the variables named according
to the aesthetics that they're mapped to. \code{scales} is a list
containing the \code{x} and \code{y} scales. There functions are called
before the facets are trained, so they are global scales, not local
to the individual panels.\code{...} contains the parameters returned by
\code{setup_params()}.
\item \code{finish_layer(data, params)}: called once for each layer. Used
to modify the data after scales has been applied, but before the data is
handed of to the geom for rendering. The default is to not modify the
data. Use this hook if the stat needs access to the actual aesthetic
values rather than the values that are mapped to the aesthetic.
\item \code{setup_params(data, params)}: called once for each layer.
Used to setup defaults that need to complete dataset, and to inform
the user of important choices. Should return list of parameters.
\item \code{setup_data(data, params)}: called once for each layer,
after \code{setup_params()}. Should return modified \code{data}.
Default methods removes all rows containing a missing value in
required aesthetics (with a warning if \code{!na.rm}).
\item \code{required_aes}: A character vector of aesthetics needed to
render the geom.
\item \code{default_aes}: A list (generated by \code{\link[=aes]{aes()}} of
default values for aesthetics.
